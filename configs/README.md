# Configs Directory
# This directory contains non-sensitive configuration files

## How to use:
1. Copy the .example files and remove the .example extension
2. Modify the configuration as needed for your environment
3. These files can be committed to Git (as they don't contain sensitive data)

## Files:
- app.conf: Application-level configuration

## Notes:
- Use this for feature flags, performance tuning, etc.
- Keep sensitive data in the secrets/ directory instead
